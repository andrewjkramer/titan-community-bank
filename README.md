# titan-community-bank
Titan Community Bank is a full-stack project that uses Node.js with Express, and MongoDB.

It began as two separate semester-long JavaScript projects built during COP 2803 Client-Side JavaScript and COP 2844 Server-Side JavaScript.

Upon completion of the semester, I took the time to learn how to connect the client-side code to the server-side code, and condense them into one folder, and host everything live on Heroku... while also learning Bootstrap.

Features:

Regex form validation  
Login/logout via LocalStorage  
Storage of transaction data via MongoDB  
Real-time updating transaction list/balance info/Chart.js via AJAX API calls to Express server

Local installation:

1. Insert your MongoDB URI key into server.js line 31  
2. Terminal: npm install  
3. Terminal: npm start
