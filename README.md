# titan-community-bank
Titan Community Bank is a full-stack project that uses Node.js with Express, and MongoDB.

It began as two separate semester-long JavaScript projects.

Upon completion of the semester, I took the time to learn how to connect the client-side code to the server-side code, and condense them into one folder, and host everything live on Heroku... while also learning Boostrap.

Features:

Login/logout via LocalStorage.
Storage of transaction data via MongoDB.
Real-time updating transaction list/balance info/Chart.js via AJAX API calls to Express server.
